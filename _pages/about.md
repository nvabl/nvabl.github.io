### Welcome to my blog

Hi! My name is Khanh. You can call me Kyle . 
I’m a materials engineer based in Hanoi and I program as a hobby. I’m currently on the way to pursue my dream in computational materials science or materials informatics. Hopefully, I would possibly make it in one day.

### More Information
This website is intended to be a very place to include some projects ranging from materials, simulation to programming, literally all stuff I have worked on. Probably I sometimes write miscellaneous posts as I would like to keep a diary to make writing a good habit. Hope you could find something useful here.
